# Exam Preparation
# Cloud Foundry Certified Developer 

Welcome to the preparation class for the Cloud Foundry Certified Developer examination. This class is designed to prepare existing Cloud Foundry users, or those who have taken Cloud Foundry Developer training, to pass the exam. *It is not a substitute for comprehensive Cloud Foundry training.*

## Overview

This prep course will include both instructor-led discussions and hands-on examples. Topics covered align with the [domains and competencies](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/cloud-foundry-certified-developer-cfcd/#domains) for the exam. To ensure this prep course does not mirror elements of the exam too closely, we will take a *functional* look at the Cloud Foundry competencies that could be covered on the exam. 

## Preparation

Before you get started, download the [cfcd-prep.zip](/cfcd-prep.zip) archive, which contains apps used by throughout the prep course. Unzip this archive somewhere on your local filesystem.
