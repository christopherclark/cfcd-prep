Cloud Foundry uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to grant access to resources. Users can be assigned to roles globally (deployment-wide) or in particular orgs and spaces.

## Global Roles

Users can be assigned to the following global roles. Capabilities for these roles span an entire Cloud Foundry deployment (foundation). As a developer user of Cloud Foundry, it is unlikely you will ever be granted one of these roles. 

* **Admin**: The admin role allows a user to perform operational actions on all orgs and spaces.
* **Admin Read-Only**: The admin read-only role allows visibility into all orgs and spaces without modification.
* **Global Auditor**: The global auditor role is similar to the `Admin Read-Only` role above except this role cannot see secrets, such as environment variable content 

## Org Roles

Org roles grant user access at the org level. 

* **OrgManager**: Org managers can administer the org (they can create/modify/delete spaces, org-level roles, domains, etc in that org). 
* **OrgAuditor**: Org auditors have read-only access to the org.
* **BillingManager**: Billing managers can create and manage billing account and payment information associated with the org in Cloud Foundry instances that have deployed the billing engine.
* **Org Users**: Read-only access to the list of other org users and their roles.

Org roles do not cascade into spaces. For example, an `OrgManager` *cannot* deploy apps to spaces in the org. However, they can grant the `SpaceDeveloper` role to a user (including themselves) for a particular space.

## Space Roles

Space roles grant user access at the space level.

* **SpaceManager**: Space managers can administer roles for a space.
* **SpaceDeveloper**: Space developers can manage apps, services and routes in a space. A user must have the `SpaceDeveloper` role to push apps.
* **SpaceAuditor**: Space auditors have read-only access to a space.
* **Space Supporters**: Troubleshoot and debug apps and service bindings in a space.
